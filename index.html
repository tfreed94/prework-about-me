      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I've always been an enormous football, baseball, and basketball fan. I watch every Browns game with my parents because they are also enormous fans! I'm also a big gamer and an amatuer streamer hoping to make it big someday!  </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Though this will probably not happen, I would love to be a professional streamer on the Twitch platform. Realistically, I would love any job involving coding. </p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I use the products of web developers in my everyday life, as I've grown older I've become motivated to learn what actually goes into these products I use. </p>
